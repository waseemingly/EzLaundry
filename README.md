# Project Scope
Project Scope (One-Sentence Version): The scope of our project is to develop a user-friendly booking system app for hostel residents to efficiently reserve washing machines and dryers, eliminating long waiting times and providing a convenient laundry experience.

Project Scope (Descriptive Version): Our project aims to design and develop a comprehensive mobile application that enables hostel residents to easily book washing machines and dryers in their respective laundries. The app will facilitate the reservation of preferred time slots, allowing users to plan their laundry tasks in advance, avoid unnecessary waiting, and ensure prompt access to available machines. The scope includes implementing features such as user registration, machine booking, authentication through QR code scanning, a payment gateway for rental charges, a cancellation policy, a notification system for reminders, and penalties for exceeding allotted time slots. The ultimate goal is to revolutionize the way hostel residents manage their laundry responsibilities, offering a streamlined and stress-free laundry experience.

# Motivation
The current situation in hostel laundries is a source of immense frustration for residents. Arriving with a load of dirty clothes, only to find every washing machine and dryer occupied, disrupts their plans and causes significant inconvenience. Residents are forced to choose between waiting indefinitely or taking a chance on returning later, without any guarantee of availability. This uncertainty disrupts their daily routines, causing stress and anxiety. However, our innovative booking system offers a solution. By empowering residents to reserve machines in advance, they can regain control over their laundry responsibilities. No longer will they be subject to luck or waste time waiting. With our app, residents can schedule their laundry sessions, ensuring a guaranteed machine when they need it. Say goodbye to wasted trips and frustration, and say hello to a more efficient and stress-free laundry experience. Embrace this opportunity to simplify your laundry routine and enhance your hostel life. Get ready for a hassle-free laundry experience like never before!

As a hostel resident, I want to be able to cancel a previously made booking for a washing machine or dryer time slot, so that I can free up the slot for other residents and avoid unnecessary charges or penalties for unused time slots.

As a hostel resident, I want to receive an alarm or notification when my reserved time slot is up, so that I can promptly retrieve my clothes from the washer or dryer and prevent inconvenience to the next user.

As a hostel resident, I want to have an authentication system in the app, using QR codes, to validate my rightful usage of the machines during my reserved time slot, so that I can ensure that only authorized users can access the machines at their designated times.

As a hostel resident, I want to have an in-app payment method and a digital wallet, so that I can conveniently make payments for the laundry service without the need to scan additional QR codes and have the laundry fees deducted from my wallet once the service is completed.
