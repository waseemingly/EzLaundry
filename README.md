# Project Scope
Project Scope (One-Sentence Version): The scope of our project is to develop a user-friendly booking system app for hostel residents to efficiently reserve washing machines and dryers, eliminating long waiting times and providing a convenient laundry experience.

Project Scope (Descriptive Version): Our project aims to design and develop a comprehensive mobile application that enables hostel residents to easily book washing machines and dryers in their respective laundries. The app will facilitate the reservation of preferred time slots, allowing users to plan their laundry tasks in advance, avoid unnecessary waiting, and ensure prompt access to available machines. The scope includes implementing features such as user registration, machine booking, authentication through QR code scanning, a payment gateway for rental charges, a cancellation policy, a notification system for reminders, and penalties for exceeding allotted time slots. The ultimate goal is to revolutionize the way hostel residents manage their laundry responsibilities, offering a streamlined and stress-free laundry experience.

# Motivation
The current situation in hostel laundries is a source of immense frustration for residents. Arriving with a load of dirty clothes, only to find every washing machine and dryer occupied, disrupts their plans and causes significant inconvenience. Residents are forced to choose between waiting indefinitely or taking a chance on returning later, without any guarantee of availability. This uncertainty disrupts their daily routines, causing stress and anxiety. However, our innovative booking system offers a solution. By empowering residents to reserve machines in advance, they can regain control over their laundry responsibilities. No longer will they be subject to luck or waste time waiting. With our app, residents can schedule their laundry sessions, ensuring a guaranteed machine when they need it. Say goodbye to wasted trips and frustration, and say hello to a more efficient and stress-free laundry experience. Embrace this opportunity to simplify your laundry routine and enhance your hostel life. Get ready for a hassle-free laundry experience like never before!

Planning Ahead: By checking the app, students can easily determine machine availability and plan their washing schedules in advance, ensuring a hassle-free laundry experience.

Timely Reminders: The app provides alarms or notifications to remind users when their reserved time slots are up, preventing forgotten clothes and inconvenience to the next user.

Authentication System: A QR code authentication system ensures that only the rightful user with a reserved time slot can access and use the specific machine, ensuring fairness and proper allocation.
