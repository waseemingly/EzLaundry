# Project Scope
Project Scope (One-Sentence Version): The scope of our project is to develop a user-friendly booking system app for hostel residents to efficiently reserve washing machines and dryers, eliminating long waiting times and providing a convenient laundry experience.

Project Scope (Descriptive Version): Our project aims to design and develop a comprehensive mobile application that enables hostel residents to easily book washing machines and dryers in their respective laundries. The app will facilitate the reservation of preferred time slots, allowing users to plan their laundry tasks in advance, avoid unnecessary waiting, and ensure prompt access to available machines. The scope includes implementing features such as user registration, machine booking, authentication through QR code scanning, a payment gateway for rental charges, a cancellation policy, a notification system for reminders, and penalties for exceeding allotted time slots. The ultimate goal is to revolutionize the way hostel residents manage their laundry responsibilities, offering a streamlined and stress-free laundry experience.

# Motivation
The current situation in hostel laundries is a source of immense frustration for residents. Arriving with a load of dirty clothes, only to find every washing machine and dryer occupied, disrupts their plans and causes significant inconvenience. Residents are forced to choose between waiting indefinitely or taking a chance on returning later, without any guarantee of availability. This uncertainty disrupts their daily routines, causing stress and anxiety. However, our innovative booking system offers a solution. By empowering residents to reserve machines in advance, they can regain control over their laundry responsibilities. No longer will they be subject to luck or waste time waiting. With our app, residents can schedule their laundry sessions, ensuring a guaranteed machine when they need it. Say goodbye to wasted trips and frustration, and say hello to a more efficient and stress-free laundry experience. Embrace this opportunity to simplify your laundry routine and enhance your hostel life. Get ready for a hassle-free laundry experience like never before!

# Key features of application
User Registration: Users can create accounts using their NUS email and password. Validation checks ensure the email is associated with the university.

Cancellation Policy: Users can cancel their bookings with a minimum notice period to free up the slot for others.

Booking Limit: Users are limited to a maximum number of bookings per week to ensure fair usage.


# Extension features of application
Notification System: A robust notification system sends reminders to users about their upcoming booking dates and times. It also alerts users when their allocated time slot is about to end to prevent unauthorized usage.

Penalties: A penalty system is in place for users who exceed their designated time slots, discouraging misuse and encouraging timely usage.

Payment Gateway (Future Extension): There will be an option to incorporate a secure payment gateway, allowing users to add funds to their app wallet for rental usage. Funds will be automatically deducted after each time slot and machine usage.Regenerate response
